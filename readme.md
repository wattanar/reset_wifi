# Why ?

I brought a new wifi adapter dual channel week ago. But it's disconnect every ~5 minute and i don't know why. I'm working on it to fix that. But before then i create this app for check connection and reconnect when this connection timed out.

# Usage

Build with command

```shell
dotnet publish -c Release
```

Copy *run.bat* and *reset_wifi.bat* to the same directory of release and run *run.bat* to start.
